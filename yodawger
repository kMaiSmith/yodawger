#   OVERVIEW
#
#   This script takes a given debian environment and adds the necessary docker
# components and folder structures to begin running a set of Multi-Organization
# Operator containers.
#

#
#   CONFIGURATIONS
#
#   All Multi-Organization Operator (moo) system files are stored in a
# hierarchy under the /yodawg directory, unless otherwise specified or needed by
# your organization.  Additional organizations that may come to operate on this
# MOO system will get their own domain structure under the /yodawg system base
#
